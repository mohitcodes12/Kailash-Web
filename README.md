# Kailash Web 🌄  
### A modern frontend project inspired by Mount Kailash

🔗 **Live Website:**  
👉 https://kailash-web.vercel.app

Kailash Web is a clean and responsive informational website built around **Mount Kailash**, a place known for its spiritual, historical, and geographical significance.

The idea behind this project was simple:  
to present meaningful information in a **calm, minimal, and user-friendly interface**, while practicing real-world frontend development and deployment.

This is a **frontend-only portfolio project**, created to strengthen my understanding of modern web tools and workflows.
