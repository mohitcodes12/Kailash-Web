          "question": "Why does Mount Kailash have such a unique shape?",
          "answer": "Mount Kailash has a distinctive pyramidal shape with four near-symmetrical faces aligned to the cardinal directions. This is due to geological forces and erosion patterns. The mountain's horizontal striations and snow channels create a naturally symmetrical appearance, which has contributed to its spiritual significance across cultures."

          "answer": "The standard Kailash Kora (outer circumambulation) takes 3 days for most pilgrims, covering 52 kilometers. Day 1: Darchen to Dirapuk (20 km). Day 2: Dirapuk over Dolma La Pass to Zutulpuk (18 km) - the most challenging day. Day 3: Zutulpuk back to Darchen (14 km). Well-acclimatized trekkers sometimes complete it in 2 days, while devoted pilgrims performing prostrations may take 2-3 weeks."

          "id": "kora-difficulty",
          "question": "How difficult is the Kailash Kora?",
          "answer": "The Kora is challenging due to high altitude (4,575m-5,630m), not technical difficulty. The main challenges are: crossing Dolma La Pass at 5,630m, altitude sickness risk, unpredictable weather, and limited facilities. Good physical fitness and proper acclimatization (at least 2-3 days in the region before starting) are essential."

          "question": "Which direction should I walk the Kora?",
          "answer": "Hindus, Buddhists, and Jains walk clockwise (pradakshina), keeping the mountain on their right as a sign of respect. Bon practitioners walk counter-clockwise (anti-clockwise). The clockwise route is more common and better established with facilities."

          "question": "What is the Inner Kora?",
          "answer": "The Inner Kora (Nandi Parikrama) is a 34 km route closer to Mount Kailash's base, considered more sacred and challenging than the outer circuit. Only those who have completed 13 outer Koras are traditionally allowed to attempt it. The route passes through more remote terrain with minimal facilities and requires special permissions."

          "id": "prostration",
          "question": "What is prostration pilgrimage?",
          "answer": "Some devoted pilgrims perform full-body prostrations for the entire 52 km Kora - lying face-down with arms outstretched, marking the spot, standing, taking a step to that mark, and repeating. This method takes 2-4 weeks to complete and is considered the most meritorious form of pilgrimage. Pilgrims wear protective gear including wooden hand-boards, leather aprons, and knee pads."

          "question": "Where do I stay during the Kora?",
          "answer": "Accommodation along the Kora is basic: guesthouses and tea houses in Dirapuk and Zutulpuk offer simple rooms (sometimes dormitory-style) and hot meals. Facilities are rudimentary - expect no running water, pit toilets, and cold conditions. Some trekkers bring camping equipment as backup. Book through your tour operator, as individual arrangements aren't possible."

          "question": "How do I prepare for the altitude?",
          "answer": "Altitude preparation is crucial: 1) Spend 2-3 days acclimatizing in Lhasa (3,650m) before traveling to Kailash region. 2) Stay 1-2 nights in Darchen before starting the Kora. 3) Consider taking Diamox (acetazolamide) - consult your doctor before the trip. 4) Stay well hydrated, avoid alcohol, and don't rush. 5) Know the symptoms of altitude sickness: headache, nausea, fatigue, shortness of breath."

          "id": "fitness",
          "question": "What fitness level is required?",
          "answer": "You need good cardiovascular fitness for the Kora. Prepare by: hiking at altitude if possible, regular cardio exercise (running, swimming, cycling) for 3-6 months before, stair climbing with a weighted backpack, and building leg strength. You don't need mountaineering skills - the Kora is a trek, not a climb. The main challenge is maintaining energy at high altitude over 3 days of walking."

          "answer": "Yes, a sleeping bag rated to at least -10°C to -15°C is essential. Guesthouses along the Kora provide beds but blankets may be insufficient for the cold nights. A quality sleeping bag ensures warmth and hygiene. Consider a sleeping bag liner for extra warmth and cleanliness. If traveling light, some tour operators rent sleeping bags, but bringing your own is recommended."

          "id": "trekking-poles",
          "question": "Are trekking poles necessary?",
          "answer": "Trekking poles are highly recommended for the Kailash Kora. They provide stability on uneven terrain, reduce stress on knees during descents (especially from Dolma La Pass), help with balance in stream crossings, and can assist with breathing rhythm at high altitude. Adjustable, lightweight poles with shock absorption are ideal."

Lord Shiva, the destroyer and transformer, meditates eternally atop Kailash with his consort Parvati. The mountain's four faces are said to be made of crystal (north), ruby (south), gold (east), and lapis lazuli (west).

The famous 11th-century story tells of the Buddhist yogi Milarepa defeating the Bon master Naro Bon-chung in a spiritual contest here, establishing Buddhism's presence at the mountain. Buddhists believe one circumambulation erases sins of a lifetime, while 108 koras can lead to enlightenment in this life."

Completing 108 circumambulations of Kailash is believed to guarantee enlightenment in this lifetime.
